## Contributing to our package

We welcome all contributions to this project! All contributors must abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Summary of Contributions

Below, briefly describe the specific contribution(s) each team member (including yourself) made to our project. 

## How the team will work together
We will have a meeting to discuss which API we should be using. Once we come to an agreement, we will divide which functions we each would like to work on. Then, we work individually in our own branches to develop the functions from start to finish including the documentation and the tests. We then create a pull request to get each of our codes reviewed before merging. After reviewing the codes, we solve any pending conflicts. Then we ensure that our packages work properly before configuring the CircleCI. If we encounter any issues, then we will solve it together as a group through direct commits in a zoom call. We will then do integration tests through CircleCI to ensure that we have passing build stamps. Then we will finalize the contributions.md and readme.md file as a group.
