## Group Work

Similar to the first mini project, everything went well and we learn a lot from each other. Each member actively and equally contributed to the project. We enjoy working together and supporting each other throughout this project. We were able to collaborate more as the understanding was build up in the mini project 1 which helped us a lot in carrying out this project. Also, we helped each other and took guidance whenever we thought we need help. Overall it was a combined efforts and as a result we are able to deliver the efficient project on time.

## Things that went poorly

Technical issues with zoom recording, otherwise everything went well.
