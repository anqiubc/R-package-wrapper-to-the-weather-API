1. I checked some API documentations such as https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/activity to find the best API to write wrapper for, and read the project requirement carefully to make sure that I have fully understood the details.

2. I started to learn how to create R packages and searched for R documentations.

1. Our group had a meeting today and decided to use the API from weatherapi.com that Evelyn found for our project. We divided tasks for each group member.

2. I explored weatherapi.com, got the API key, and read the API documentation, espically for the astronomy API.

3. We built a github repo for our project, and decided to do our work in our own branch before merge it into main.

Github link for our project: https://github.com/xintian927/534-proejct

1. I create R package template for my task.

2. I implemented astronomy API wrapper, include tasks such as write wrapper functions with inline comment.

3. I wrote documentation for my code, and generated `/man` directory which storing the documentation.

4. I wrote specific test code to test the edge case of the wrapper, making sure the function handles errors gracefully and returns helpful error messages to invaild input.

5. I wrote vignette file to create a full work flow for my task.
